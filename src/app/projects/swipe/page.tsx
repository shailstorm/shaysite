            <p>
                Members and alumni of The Recurse Center are often looking to
                pair together on coding projects or challenges. 
                This is an integral part of a batch at Recurse.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h1 className="text-lg text-gray-600">Recurser Needs</h1>
            <ul className="">
                <li><b>Share</b> what they are working on.</li>
                <li><b>Exposure to and information about</b> what other Recursers are working on.</li>
                <li><b>Track progress</b> on projects that excite them.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h1 className="text-lg text-gray-600">Current Method</h1>

            <p>
                Currently, people find projects via the Zulip messaging platform, where each project lives in a separate Zulip discussion thread.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are a lot of conversations to sift through, so <b>projects get lost</b>.
                </li>
               
                <li>
                    There is no standard to follow when uploading or finding information about a project.{" "}
                    <b>Important details get left out</b>, or buried in paragraphs.
                </li>

                When considering a project, Recursers want to know:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Languages and tech stack</li>
                <li>The project&apos;s goal and where it currently stands in relation to the goal.</li>
            </ul>
