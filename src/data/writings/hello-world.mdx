<br></br>

since moving to nyc at the beginning of april to attend <u><a href="http://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">recurse center</a></u>, i've been feeling so newborn.

<br></br>

starting over isn't only an act of packing up and swapping into a totally new set of behaviors/environs

<br></br>

but also wiping the slate clean, allowing the past its rest. pretending that this moment is my first moment on earth.

<br></br>

one might think of forgiveness as a ritual..,, a prayer, a cleansing
