*"If we look at Things just 'theoretically', we can get along without understanding readiness-to-hand. 
But when we deal with them by using them and manipulating them, this activity is not a blind one; 
it has its own kind of sight, by which our manipulation is guided and from which it acquires its specific Thingly character."*
