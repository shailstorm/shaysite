This document is alive . . . it will change and grow.

- What's the difference? Change is inevitable. Growth is directional change.
Knowing what I want establishes a direction to change in.

<br />

- Communication is a non-zero-sum way to share and scale value. 
Conversations should equilibrate towards being pertinent for at least one party or interesting for all parties.

<br />

- There is an uncountable number of ways to waste time when avoiding decision-making.
Lots of traits that look like constrained action are chalked up to a lack of discipline (e.g. procrastination). 
But in my experience these are actually indicators of indecision. 
Is that why it's called a deadlock?

<br />

- I have no reason not to trust myself. Proof by 2x2 cases:
    - If I trust myself and do right, most likely my self-efficacy increases. <br />
    - If I trust myself and mess up, most likely I own and learn from the experience. <br />
    - If I don't trust myself and mess up, most likely I either regret not trusting myself or I support a narrative against trusting myself. <br />
    - If I don't trust myself and happen to do right, most likely I either feel imposter syndrome or my self-efficacy increases. <br />

- Alliances are important. Friendships are well-rounded alliances. A romantic relationship is a maximally well-rounded alliance.
