- Change is inevitable.
Knowing what I want enables directional change, aka growth.

<br />

- The people I want to be around don't care if I skip small talk. Communication is a non-zero-sum way to share and scale value. 
Conversations should equilibrate towards being pertinent for at least one party or interesting for all parties.

<br />

- There is an uncountable number of ways to waste time when avoiding decision-making. Indecision is my archnemesis.

<br />

- I have no reason not to trust myself. Proof by cases:
    - If I trust myself and do right, my self-efficacy increases. <br />
    - If I trust myself and mess up, I must take accountability, so I must learn. <br />
    - If I don't trust myself and mess up, I regret not trusting myself. <br />
    - If I don't trust myself and happen to do right, I weaponize the experience against trusting myself. <br />

<br />

- When it comes to learning from others, I can pick up the stuff that is useful and simply leave what I don't need.

<br />

- Alliances are important. Friendships are well-rounded alliances. A romantic relationship is a maximally well-rounded alliance.
