- I have no reason not to trust myself. Proof by 2x2 cases:
    - If I trust myself and do right, most likely my self-efficacy increases. <br />
    - If I trust myself and mess up, most likely I own and learn from the experience. <br />
    - If I don't trust myself and mess up, most likely I either regret not trusting myself or I support a narrative against trusting myself. <br />
    - If I don't trust myself and happen to do right, most likely I either feel imposter syndrome or my self-efficacy increases. <br />

- When it comes to learning from others, I can pick up the stuff that is useful and simply leave what I don't need.
