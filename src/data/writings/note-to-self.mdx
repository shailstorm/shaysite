- Change is inevitable.
Knowing what I want enables directional change, aka growth.

<br />

- The people I want to be around don't care if I skip small talk. Communication is a non-zero-sum way to share and scale value. 
Conversations should equilibrate towards being pertinent for at least one party or interesting for all parties.

<br />

- There is an uncountable number of ways to waste time when avoiding decision-making. Indecision is my archnemesis.

<br />

- I have no reason not to trust myself.
If I trust myself and mess up, I must take accountability, so I must learn. 
If I don't trust myself and I mess up, I can use it as further evidence to doubt myself.

<br />

- When it comes to learning from others, I can pick up the stuff that is useful and simply leave what I don't need.

<br />

- Alliances are important. Friendships are well-rounded alliances. A romantic relationship is a maximally well-rounded alliance.
