<h1>solitude with friends</h1>
<h2>july 20, 2025</h2>

Becoming comfortable with feeling unseen is starting to prevent me from confusing other people's desires as my own.

<br />

I want to show up for my life <a href="https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/life-spirit-distillation" 
target="_blank">in my own way</a><span className="text-[#BEBDC9]">&#8599;</span>. It's wasteful to
be distracted by things that aren't true desires but masquerading as such: eg. social climbing up a bad ladder
or falling for advertising gimmicks.

<br />

I save time by siding with myself and daring to be alone or misunderstood, instead of denying, defending,
or feigning for solidarity.

<br />

When I trust my ability to stand alone as part of a complex world, I drop the fearful 
narrative of being left behind or underachievingâ€“ freeing me to just explore.

<br />

Ironically, my lonely striving has consistently led me to well-fitting people and settings. 
I value being alone, together. 
I think seeking love and support is done out of one's own strength and desire for strength. 
An important use case of friendships for me is the knowledge that awesome people think I'm awesome, 
and to be able to support them in the same way.
I am incredibly lucky to have friends and loved ones whom I deeply respect and admire. 
Their loving response to seeing just a part of my strength convinces me that it's worth realizing the rest for myself.
