<h1>solitude with friends</h1>
<h2>july 20, 2025</h2>

I'm naturally introverted with my feelings and beliefs. 
I wasn't convinced that I might stand to gain by presenting my inner world legibly.
Now I realize that many of the ways I have changed my life favorably were acts of extroversion, where I 
materialized a decision by generating authentic output.
Earnest extroversion communicates who you are and what you want (often implicitly), which filters for 
people you can mutually benefit from engaging with.
I'd like to practice this more, online and not.
This is why I've made space on my website for writing.

<br />

The act of living <a href="https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/life-spirit-distillation" 
target="_blank">in my own way</a> is salient to me. I don't want to
be distracted by things that aren't real desires but masquerading as such: eg. climbing up a wrong social ladder,
being <a href="https://srconstantin.github.io/2016/10/20/ra.html" target="_blank">captured by Ra</a>,
or falling for advertising gimmicks.
So I side with myself and risk solitude rather than defend or feign for short-term solidarity.

<br />

The results of this are experientially apparent to me. More and more, I find myself surrounded by people and things I admire. I feel supported in strategizing
to achieve what I want, and I enjoy supporting others similarly.
