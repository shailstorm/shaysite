<h1>solitude with friends</h1>
<h2>july 20, 2025</h2>

I'm naturally introverted with my feelings and beliefs. 
I hadn't thought about what I might stand to gain by presenting my inner world legibly.
Lately I'm realizing that most of the ways I have changed my life favorably were actually acts of extroversion, where I turned an inward decision outward.
Earnest extroversion implicitly communicates who you are, and I'd like to practice it more. 
To feel seen, I need to generate authentic output, whether that be online or in-person, in the form of art, tweets, etc.
This is why I've made a space on my website for writing publically.

The act of living
<a href="https://contraptions.venkateshrao.com/p/life-spirit-distillation" 
target="_blank">in my own way</a> is salient to me. I don't want to
be distracted by things that aren't real desires but masquerading as such: eg. social climbing up a bad ladder,
being <a href="https://srconstantin.github.io/2016/10/20/ra.html" target="_blank">captured by Ra</a>,
or falling for advertising gimmicks.
I'd rather side with myself and risk solitude than defend or feign for short-term solidarity.
