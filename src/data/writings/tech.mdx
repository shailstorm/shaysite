I started writing HTML and CSS for my friends' Tumblr blog pages and making digital art using my friend's 
Wacom tablet in 2014.

<br />

Ten years later, at 22, I finally made a Twitter account and drifted further online, scouring web archives
of blogs, apps, games, art, and my sister's tweets about design and the worthiness of creating and sharing beautiful experiences.
I was a young kid during the 2010s smart phone/social media surge in tech, where there was room for optimism
that tech workers' hours were spent in service of a more inclusive, better-connected, playful, and non-zero-sum future.

<br />

I'm in search of people who still care about this vision, who fight for connection with friends and see
goodness and healing as worthy choices, and who, without prejudice, see others sharing this sentiment as allies in their pursuits.

<br />

That tech can still (and always) be just as easily wielded to bring forth a vision of an <i>uplifted</i> future as it can be to bring forth 
wastefulness and pretenses.

<br />

The question I relentlessly ask myself, and believe more of GenZ could ask of ourselves is, what's worth spending our lives to bring forth?

<br />

We've generated some truly weird and beautiful shit, and I'm continuously inspired by edge-pushers. 
My spirit, shoddy and mistaken as it can be, is right there with y'all.
