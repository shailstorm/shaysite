I started climbing a few months ago and it's a lesson in *Do or do not, there is no try*.

<br />
I'm scared of heights, so by the time I'm at the top of a wall, a storm of thoughts is advising me to give up.
At first I gave considerable attention to this advice, and it would usually come true: 
time spent on the wall deliberating or trying to 'motivate' myself fatigues my arms. 
I've fallen off the wall countless times from a half-assed attempt at reaching the next hold. 

<br />

At some point I realized I can just kind of ignore the entire thought contraption and fully go for
the hold before the thoughts totally influence reality.

<br />
I refer to these types of deliberating thoughts as 'trying'.
The cognitive load of 'trying' is probably scaffolding some intent of will that ultimately causes 'doing'.

<br />

"Motivating" myself or coaxing myself to "try" can quickly become just sitting comfortably in my anxiety. 
The fact that I think I need convincing is repeatedly confessing doubt, which creates more doubt.
Over time, I break down trust in myself and my environment despite having no rational reason to.

<br />

I guess "trying" is narrative-based, while "doing" is reality-based. I don't totally understand why sometimes I *try*, 
but other times I *do*, even when in each situation I desire the same outcome. Empirically, I've noticed:

a. When trust outpaces fear, the doing happens before the trying needs to happen.\
b. When I notice myself in a "trying" loop without actually attempting anything, 
I can exit the loop.\
c. Each attempt/failure is necessary to get me to the part where my instincts have a greater say.
