I started climbing a few months ago and it's been a lesson in *Do or do not, there is no try*.

<br />
I'm scared of heights, so by the time I'm at the top of a wall, a storm of thoughts is advising me to give up.
At first I gave considerable attention to this advice, and it would usually come true: 
time spent on the wall deliberating or trying to 'motivate' myself fatigues my arms. 
I've fallen off the wall countless times from a half-assed attempt at reaching the next hold. 

<br />

At some point I realized I can just kind of ignore the entire thought contraption and fully go for
the hold before my well-meaning thoughts unfavorably influence reality.

<br />
Often when I say I'm "trying", I'm referring to having these thoughts.
Trying can quickly turn into sitting uncomfortably unable to make a decision, becoming anxious about this, and entering into further meta-anxieties. Repeatedly confessing doubt, thus spawning meta-doubt.
With each passing moment, the activation energy required of any possible next move becomes higher relative to the amount of energy I have for a next move (the energy is trapped by indecision).

<br />

I guess "trying" is narrative-constructing, while "doing" is reality-constructing. I don't totally understand why sometimes I *try*, 
but other times I *do*, even when in each situation I desire the same outcome. 
Maybe the cognitive load of 'trying' is subconsciously scaffolding some intent of will that ultimately causes 'doing'.

<br />
Empirically, I've noticed:

<ul>
    <li>When trust outpaces the next thought, the doing happens before the trying needs to happen.</li>
    <li>When I catch myself in a "trying" loop without attempting anything, 
    I have no choice but to ignore my brain and make a decision that isn't the path of least-resistance.</li>
</ul>
